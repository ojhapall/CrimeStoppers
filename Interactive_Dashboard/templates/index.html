          Looking at weather and crime in the Toronto Region, we are able to see that crime is affected by many factors
          including the temperature, season and day of the week. Using these metrics, the police force can use this tool
          to determine the crime hot spots and crime types.

      <h3>Initial Machine Learning Analysis: Linear Regression</h3>
    </div>

      <p>
        We are using a supervised learning model as we are analysing labelled data. We have tested various different
        machine learning models to determine what the best fit would be. We began with a linear regression model. The
        regression modelâ€™s algorithm would attempt to learn patterns that exist among mean temperature, day of the week,
        hour of the day, season and crime rate. We would use this model to predict the crime rate when presented with a
        temperature based on previously learned patterns from the dataset. This model was successful but we wanted to
        test and see if there would be a better result with another model. We then tested a Random Forest Classifier
        which was not successful.

      This model is used for time series forecasting and we used it to see if based on the date information of the crimes committed we could forecast the crime rates for the coming years. This model was very successful and is the model we chose as our final model.
