## Topic
Crime rates/ types in Toronto vs the weather on the date of the crime

## Reason for picking topic
To help reduce the crime rates by predicting the hot spot neighbourhoods where crime will be commited based on the forecasted weather for each day

## Data Source
Our data source is a combination of kaggle data on historic toronto climate as well as data from Toronto police on crimes committed between 2014 to 2019. The crime data includes the type of crime, date committed, day of the week crime was committed and the neighbourhood it was committed in.

## Questions we would like to answer
- Are there more crimes committed when the weather is warmer?
- Are there specific neighbourhoods that there is a higher crime rate depending on the weather being warmer?
- Is there a day of the week that there are more crimes committed?
- Is there a specific season that more crimes are commited?
- Do the type of crimes differ depending on the weather and season?

## Communication Protocol
We created a slack group with all 4 members as well as a google docs group to track our progress. We determined all roles and provided timelines of when each role should be done with their tasks so the remaining members can complete their tasks for the week.
