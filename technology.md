# Technologies Used
## Data Cleaning and Analysis
We will use Pandas to clean our data along with other Python functions.

## Database Storage
We will use postgres SQL for data storage. 

## Machine Learning
SciKitLearn is the machine learning library we'll be using to create our machine learning model. We will also be using pathlib, matplotlip.pylot, numpy and sklearn.preprocessing for our machine learning model analysis and testin. 

## Dashboard
In addition to using a Flask template, we will also integrate D3.js. For displaying our dashboard we will use javascript and html to create our own webpage for hosting the results.
